__HW1__: Basic Kalman Filter for a linear motion robot. Uses linear motion and observation models and the robot moves in a straight line diagonally.

__HW2__: Extended Kalman Filter, using both the linear measurement model from HW1 and a new measurement model that uses distance and bearing between the robot and a landmark.
